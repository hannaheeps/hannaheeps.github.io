  <p>Well, this is my first post. Filler Text Goes here. Serenity is a 2005 space western film written and directed by Joss Whedon. It is a continuation of the short-lived 2002 Fox science fiction television series Firefly, taking place after the events of the final episode. Set in 2517, Serenity is the story of the captain and crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship. The captain and first mate are veterans of the Unification War, having fought on the losing side. Their lives of petty crime are interrupted by a psychic passenger who harbors a dangerous secret.</p>

<p>The film was released in North America on September 30, 2005 by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews and was number two during its opening weekend but it did not make back its budget until its release on DVD. Serenity won numerous awards, including the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.</p>
